As a non-trivial software system, the AIA SDK has some known limitations and problems. The following is a list of problems we are aware of.

## Announcements

We have not tested [Alexa announcements](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/acm/announcements-acm.html) yet.

## Tune-In

We have a known bug in the AIA Service we are actively working on that prevents the playback of certain Tune-In stations.
